# ASTOQUILCA-MAY-Data-Science-Portfolio
This directory contains the projects I have worked on during my Introduction to Data Science course. Throughout the course, I will learn core machine learning concepts including model selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. I will also gain exposure to topics such as neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for analytics and decision-making. By the end of this course, I will have created a portfolio of data-driven web applications, integrating exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and LLMs to solve practice problems and commincate findings.
